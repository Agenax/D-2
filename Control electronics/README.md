There are two pcbs couples I've made for D-1 and D-2, to be honest none of them perectly work.
Actually I'm using a dedicated radio-module that offers a better connection instead of the nrf24l01 module.
On D1's controllers, there's a problem with radio-module (the chip), I think it is caused by the bad impedency beetwen the chip and the antenna.
On D2 ones, the problem is ways more mysterious, I've decided to use already made radio modules to avoid impedency issues, but even if the tension was correct and everything seemed right both of the modules burned...
