# NGESC

Here's NGESC page.

NGESC stands for Next Generation Electronic Speed Control, it is a personnal attempt to develop an analogic ESC using less microcontrollers but transistors instead.
It permits being mode able to repair this kind of componnent and also increase their reliability.

I don't have anything to share now because it is still under development but I hope to finish it soon.
